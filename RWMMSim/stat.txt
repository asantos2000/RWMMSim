# Model used: Random Waypoint model
# Number of nodes: 15
# Time [s]: 600.0 seconds
# Min speed [m/s]: 1.0
# Max speed [m/s]: 4.0
# Min pause time [s]: 2.0
# Max pause time [s]: 10.0
# Currently disregarding the first 10.0 seconds
# Resolution [s]: 0.2
# Maximum X-size [m]: 300.0
# Maximum Y-size [m]: 300.0
#
#==========================================


 Connectivity matrix at simulation start.
Node with lowest index is in the top left corner.
Legend: 2 means IN range, 1 means Interference range, 0 means out of range.
Eg. [1][3]==2 means that nodes 1 and 3 are in range of eachother.

#NONODES: 15
